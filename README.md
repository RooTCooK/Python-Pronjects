# Python_Projects

## Introduction

> This is my first project coding by python, sended to GitHub.
> The most time i spend is to install the library files. You must laugh at me because I can use simple way by useing PIP to instal. I had try, but I fail, because the internet was terrible to connect official website in china. So i learn to use file .whl to install. All of this is never enough, i has learn to use mirror to fight with trouble. Finally I successfully code out the project with many helps from internet and www.bilibili.com. Thanks them.

> I will keep on going to learn and have a best jion in my daily life.
